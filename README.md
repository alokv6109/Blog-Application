# Blog-Application
Blog Application with various versions for the various learning stages

this application is made for the very nice understanding of how the backend appliaction runs
I've tried to accumulate the various stages in hich the work is done
and every time ill take another branch and then try to keep various codes/changes in that
 where 1 stage is jwt with role based authentication
 
 And the second stage consist of the swagger api documentaton ie done
 so that the swagger can be genrated and the api testing can be done by
 some person who wants to know the structure of the apis
